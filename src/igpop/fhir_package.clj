;; Format
;; A FHIR package is a tarball (tar in gzip). The package contains
;;     a subfolder named 'package'
;;     a package manifest (package/package.json)
;;     an index file (package/.index.json)
;;     A set of resource files, also in the package subfolder
;;     It MAY contain additional content, like example resources or documentation:
;;         such files SHALL not be in the package subfolder
;;         Example resources SHOULD be placed in an /examples folder.
;;         Tools working with examples, SHALL understand this. Note that the interpretation of what is an example resource can be unclear in some cases
;;         this may include XML schemas in an "xml" subfolder
;;         this may include openAPI files in an "openapi" subfolder
;;         this may include turtle RDF representations in an rdf folder
;;         Package consumers SHALL ignore content in other subfolders that they do not use (and most consumers will only use the resources in /package)
;;
;; Tarballs SHALL be in the original tarball format (e.g. a 99 character file name length limit).Te examples
